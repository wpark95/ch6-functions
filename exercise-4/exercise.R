# Exercise 4: functions and conditionals

# Define a function `is_twice_as_long` that takes in two character strings, and 
# returns whether or not (e.g., a boolean) the length of one argument is greater
# than or equal to twice the length of the other.
# Hint: compare the length difference to the length of the smaller string

is_twice_as_long <- function(str1, str2) {
  diff <- abs(nchar(str1) - nchar(str2))
  min_length <- min(nchar(str1), nchar(str2));
  diff >= min_length 
}


# Call your `is_twice_as_long` function by passing it different length strings
# to confirm that it works. Make sure to check when _either_ argument is twice
# as long, as well as when neither are!

is_twice_as_long("dog", "elephant")
is_twice_as_long("elephant", "dog")
is_twice_as_long("dog", "cat")


# Define a function `describe_difference` that takes in two strings. The
# function should return one of the following sentences as appropriate
#   "Your first string is longer by N characters"
#   "Your second string is longer by N characters"
#   "Your strings are the same length!"

describe_difference <- function(first,second) {
  diff <- nchar(first) - nchar(second)
  if(diff > 0) {
    sentence <- paste("Your first string is longer by", diff, "characters")
  } else if(diff < 0) {
    sentence <- paste("Your second string is longer by", -diff, "characters")
  } else {
    sentence <- "Your strings are the same length!"
  }
  sentence  # return the sentence
}


# Call your `describe_difference` function by passing it different length strings
# to confirm that it works. Make sure to check all 3 conditions1

describe_difference("dog", "elephant")
describe_difference("elephant", "dog")
describe_difference("dog", "cat")
